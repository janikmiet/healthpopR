\title{Plot Survival Curve for Mortality Analysis}
\usage{
plot_survival_death(
  data,
  scale = c("days", "years"),
  surv.median.line = "v",
  colors = c("#D9534F", "#5BC0DE")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the following variables:
\describe{
  \item{value}{Numeric; time to event or censoring in days.}
  \item{status}{Binary; event indicator (1 = event occurred, 0 = censored).}
  \item{GROUP}{Factor or character; grouping variable for comparison.}
}}

\item{scale}{years or days (timeline)}

\item{colors}{A character vector of color hex codes to use for plotting.
Default is \code{c("#D9534F", "#5BC0DE")}.}
}
\value{
A `ggsurvplot` object from the \pkg{survminer} package, containing
  the Kaplan–Meier plot with survival probabilities, confidence intervals,
  p-value, and risk table.
}
\description{
This function generates a Kaplan–Meier survival plot comparing groups based on
survival or mortality data. It uses the `survival` and `survminer` packages to
fit the model and visualize survival probabilities over time.
}
\details{
The function fits a survival model using \code{survival::survfit()} and
visualizes it with \code{survminer::ggsurvplot()}. It is typically used to
analyze mortality data between exposure and non-exposure groups.

  GROUP = c("Exposure", "No Exposure", "Exposure", "No Exposure", "Exposure", "No Exposure")
