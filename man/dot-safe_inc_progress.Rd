\title{Safely Increment Shiny Progress Bar}
\usage{
.safe_inc_progress(amount = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{amount}{Numeric value indicating how much to increment the progress bar by. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
No return value; called for its side effect of updating the progress bar.
}
\description{
A helper function that safely increments a Shiny progress bar
only when the Shiny app is running and within a reactive context.
}
\details{
This function checks whether the Shiny application is running and whether
there is a valid reactive domain before calling `shiny::incProgress()`. It prevents
errors when the progress bar is used outside of a reactive environment or during
testing/non-interactive use.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
withProgress(message = "Loading...", {
  for (i in 1:10) {
    safe_inc_progress(0.1)
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
  }
})
}
