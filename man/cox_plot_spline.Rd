\title{Plot Spline Effect from Cox Proportional Hazards Model}
\usage{
cox_plot_spline(
  data_model,
  spline_var = "age_bs",
  title = "Spline effect",
  xlab = NULL,
  ylab = "Predicted risk",
  color = "#0072B2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_model}{A fitted Cox proportional hazards model object created with `coxph()` and spline terms (e.g., using `splines::bs()`).}

\item{spline_var}{Character string specifying the name of the spline variable in the model to visualize (e.g., `"age_bs"` or `"bmi"`).}

\item{title}{Character string specifying the title of the plot. Default is `"Spline effect"`.}

\item{xlab}{Optional label for the x-axis. If `NULL`, the variable name will be used.}

\item{ylab}{Label for the y-axis. Default is `"Predicted risk"`.}

\item{color}{Character string with a valid color for the line and confidence ribbon. Default is Bootstrap blue `"#0072B2"`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the effect of the spline-transformed variable with a confidence ribbon.
}
\description{
Generates a plot showing the spline-transformed effect of a continuous variable in a Cox model
using predicted marginal effects with confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The function uses `ggeffects::ggpredict()` to compute marginal effects across the full range of the spline variable.
It assumes the model was created using natural splines via `splines::bs()` and includes the variable named in `spline_var`.

model <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ splines::bs(age, df = 4), data = lung)

# Plot the spline effect
p <- cox_plot_spline(model, spline_var = "age", title = "Effect of Age")
