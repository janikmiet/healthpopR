\title{Classify ICD-10 Profiles by Exposure Group}
\usage{
classify_icd10_profile(
  data,
  diagnoses = diagnoses,
  exposure_icd10 = "",
  exposure_src = c("")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the study population with at least columns `ID` and `exp.GROUP`,
where `exp.GROUP` distinguishes between exposure and non-exposure groups. Can be created by classify_population() -function.}

\item{diagnoses}{A Original data frame of diagnoses that must include columns `ID`, `DGREG`, `DG`, `SRC`, and `ICD10_CLASS`.}

\item{exposure_icd10}{A regular expression string that defines the ICD-10 diagnosis used to define the exposure group.
Diagnoses matching this pattern are excluded from the analysis.}

\item{exposure_src}{A character vector of source types (e.g., `"avohilmo"`, `"hilmo"`, etc.) to include in the filtering.}
}
\value{
A wide-format data frame with ICD-10 class percentages by exposure group. Includes artificial `"Max"` and `"Min"`
  rows (100 and 0) for visualization purposes.
}
\description{
This function creates a summary table of ICD-10 diagnosis class distributions across exposure groups,
excluding diagnoses matching a specified ICD-10 pattern (e.g., the exposure-defining diagnosis).
It calculates patient percentages per diagnosis class and reshapes the result into a wide-format matrix
suitable for plotting (e.g., radar charts or heatmaps).
}
\details{
The function internally calculates:
- Population sizes for each exposure group
- Diagnosis counts and patient counts per ICD-10 class
- Percentages of patients per group with each diagnosis class

If run inside a Shiny application, it will display progress bars using `withProgress()`.
