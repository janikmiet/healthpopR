\title{Bar Plot of ICD-10 Diagnosis Differences Between Exposure Groups}
\usage{
plot_icd10_diff_by_exposure(
  data,
  limit = 10,
  colors = c("#5BC0DE66", "#D9534F66")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing ICD-10 comparison results, typically produced by
\code{\link{tbl_icd10_diff_by_exposure}}. Must include the columns: `ICD10_3LETTERS`,
`exposure_group_pct`, `no_exposure_group_pct`, and `diff_pct`.}

\item{limit}{Numeric value (default = 10). Only diagnoses with a group percentage
difference greater than this threshold will be plotted.}

\item{colors}{A character vector of two color values (with optional alpha), used for the
exposure and no-exposure group bars respectively. Defaults to `c("#5BC0DE66", "#D9534F66")`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object showing a grouped horizontal bar chart of the selected ICD-10
diagnosis codes, comparing the exposure and no-exposure group percentages.
}
\description{
Creates a horizontal bar plot to visualize differences in ICD-10 diagnosis percentages
between exposure and non-exposure groups, filtered by a specified percentage difference threshold.
}
\details{
The function filters ICD-10 codes to include only those where the absolute difference in
diagnosis prevalence (`diff_pct`) exceeds the specified threshold. The plot flips the
coordinate system to display diagnoses vertically for better readability.

Colors are manually assigned for visual clarity and can be customized. The plot uses
the `hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()` theme.

The function supports integration with Shiny and shows progress via `withProgress()`
and `.safe_inc_progress()` if inside a Shiny app.
