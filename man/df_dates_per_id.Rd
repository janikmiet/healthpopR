\title{Construct per-ID date dataset with follow-up starting at age 50}
\usage{
df_dates_per_id(exposure_diagnoses, response_diagnoses, dpop)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure_diagnoses}{A data frame containing exposure diagnoses with
variables \code{ID} and \code{DATE}.}

\item{response_diagnoses}{A data frame containing response diagnoses with
variables \code{ID} and \code{DATE}.}

\item{dpop}{A population data frame containing at least \code{ID},
\code{DATE_BIRTH}, \code{DATE_DEATH}, and \code{DATE_MIGRATION}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per individual, including exposure date,
  response date, birth date, age-50 date, death date, and migration date.
}
\description{
Creates a person-level dataset containing exposure and response diagnosis
dates, demographic dates, and age-50 baseline. Exposure and response events
occurring before age 50 are set to \code{NA}. Follow-up is intended to start
from the 50th birthday.
}
\details{
Exposure and response diagnosis dates occurring before age 50 are excluded
by setting them to \code{NA}. Age 50 is calculated as
\code{DATE_BIRTH + 50 * 365.25}.

The function joins exposure and response diagnoses to the population data
and returns a per-ID dataset suitable for survival or competing risks analyses.
