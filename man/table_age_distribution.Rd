\title{Summarize Age Distribution for Exposure or Response Groups}
\usage{
table_age_distribution(data, group = "exposure", subgroups = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing columns `exp.GROUP`, `resp.GROUP`, `exp.AGE_DG`, and `resp.AGE_DG`.
These are expected to represent exposure/response group labels and ages at diagnosis.}

\item{group}{A character string, either `"exposure"` or `"response"`, indicating which group to summarize.
Defaults to `"exposure"`.}

\item{subgroups}{Logical. If `TRUE`, adds subgroup statistics (cross-group summaries). Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the population size (`pop_n`) and age statistics:
\itemize{
  \item \code{pop_n} - Population count
  \item \code{age_min} - Minimum age at diagnosis
  \item \code{age_median} - Median age at diagnosis
  \item \code{age_mean} - Mean age at diagnosis
  \item \code{age_max} - Maximum age at diagnosis
}
When `subgroups = TRUE`, an additional "All" row summarizes the entire group.
}
\description{
Creates a summary table of population counts and age statistics (minimum, median, mean, and maximum)
for either the "exposure" or "response" group. Optionally, it can also include subgroups for a more
detailed breakdown.
}
\details{
This function is intended for use in both interactive and Shiny contexts.
It utilizes `.safe_inc_progress()` to update progress during computation.
