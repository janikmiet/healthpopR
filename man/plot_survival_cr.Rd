\title{Plot Competing Risks Survival Curve}
\usage{
plot_survival_cr(data, colors = c("#5CB85C", "#343A40"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in long format with the following required columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{Subject ID}
  \item{name}{Type of event: must include `"diagnose"` for response, `"dead"` for death, and others are treated as censoring}
  \item{value}{Time (in days) from exposure to event}
}}

\item{colors}{A character vector of color hex codes to use for the plotted event types. Default is `c("#5CB85C", "#343A40")`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object showing the cumulative incidence curves for competing risks.
}
\description{
Plots a cumulative incidence function from a long-format dataset using a competing risks model.
}
\details{
Internally converts event types into status codes for competing risks analysis:
\itemize{
  \item 1 = diagnose (response)
  \item 2 = dead
  \item 3 = censored
}
Uses `cuminc()` from the `cmprsk` package and visualizes the results using `ggcompetingrisks()`.
Designed to run in both interactive and Shiny environments, using `.safe_inc_progress()` for optional progress updates.
