\title{Plot Survival Curves from Cox Model Data}
\usage{
cox_plot_overall(
  data,
  type = c("event", "cumhaz", "pct"),
  colors_exposure_groups = c("#5BC0DE", "#D9534F"),
  legend_labels = c("No exposure", "Exposure"),
  conf_int = TRUE,
  risk_table = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the survival object (e.g., `Surv`) and exposure variable.
The survival object must already be computed (typically by `cox_create_data()`), and the data should be ready for plotting.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of plot to generate. Options are:
`"event"` for number of events over time,
`"cumhaz"` for cumulative hazard,
`"pct"` for survival percentage. Default is `"pct"`.}

\item{colors_exposure_groups}{A character vector of color codes for the exposure groups. Default is Bootstrap-themed: `c("#5BC0DE", "#D9534F")`.}

\item{legend_labels}{A character vector of labels for the exposure groups shown in the legend. Default is `c("No exposure", "Exposure")`.}

\item{conf_int}{Logical. Whether to display confidence intervals (only applies if `type = "pct"`). Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{risk_table}{Logical. Whether to include a risk table below the survival plot (only applies if `type = "pct"`). Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A `ggsurvplot` object, which can be printed or further modified with `ggplot2` functions.
}
\description{
Visualizes survival information using different representations (events, cumulative hazard, or survival percentage)
for exposure groups based on a precomputed survival object.
}
\details{
The function expects the input data to already include a survival object named `Surv`, such as one created via
`Surv(tstart, tstop, diagnose)` within `cox_create_data()`. The exposure variable should also be present and
appropriately formatted.
