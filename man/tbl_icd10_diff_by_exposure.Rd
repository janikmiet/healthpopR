\title{Compare ICD-10 Diagnoses Between Exposure Groups}
\usage{
tbl_icd10_diff_by_exposure(data, diagnoses, exposure_icd10, exposure_src)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with at least `ID` and `exp.GROUP` columns, where `exp.GROUP`
should include `"exposure"` and `"no exposure"` as values.}

\item{diagnoses}{A data frame containing patient diagnosis records. Must include at least
the columns: `ID`, `DGREG`, `DG`, `ICD10_3LETTERS`, and `SRC`.}

\item{exposure_icd10}{A regular expression string defining the ICD-10 pattern used to classify
exposure. Diagnoses matching this pattern will be excluded from analysis.}

\item{exposure_src}{A character vector of source systems (e.g., `c("hilmo", "avohilmo")`)
to include in the diagnosis filtering.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing:
\describe{
  \item{ICD10_3LETTERS}{ICD-10 3-letter code}
  \item{total_patients}{Total patients across both exposure groups with this diagnosis}
  \item{exposure_group_patients}{Number of patients in the exposure group with this diagnosis}
  \item{exposure_group_pct}{Percent of the exposure group with this diagnosis}
  \item{no_exposure_group_patients}{Number of patients in the no-exposure group with this diagnosis}
  \item{no_exposure_group_pct}{Percent of the no-exposure group with this diagnosis}
  \item{diff_pct}{Difference in percentage points between groups (exposure minus no exposure)}
  \item{DESC}{ICD-10 code description (from `data_codes`)}
}
}
\description{
Calculates and compares the prevalence of top ICD-10 diagnosis codes (3-letter level)
between exposure and non-exposure populations. Designed to highlight diagnostic differences
across groups while excluding the exposure-defining ICD-10 codes.
}
\details{
This function is useful for summarizing diagnostic differences between exposed and unexposed groups.
It excludes diagnoses matching the exposure ICD-10 pattern to avoid circularity.

Internally uses `.safe_inc_progress()` for progress tracking and integrates with Shiny's
`withProgress()` if called from a running Shiny session.

**Note**: The `data_codes` object must be available in the global environment or within the package,
and must contain `CODECLASS == "ICD10"`, `DG`, and `DESC` columns.
